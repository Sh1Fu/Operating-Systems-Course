# Operating-Systems-Course

Hi all, in this repository you will find the solutions to the lab papers on the subject of Operating Systems. They are not perfect, so feel free to criticise them :>

The directory structure is as follows:

| Directory | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| OsLoader | Source code for the first lab: boot loader, operating system kernel and a script to automate building |
| Reports | Reports for each lab in two formats: docx and pdf |
| Sockets | 4 sources: two socket clients, and two servers. You can see from the name of the files what protocol the sockets use |
| Systems | Contains an archive of all the disc dumps used in my lab |
| Threads | Source code on the subject of multithreading. The only downside: no task description |

> Please, when using the labs, do not copy the code entirely, much less the reports. It is your responsibility to ensure that the teacher can turn you around for copywriting the work
